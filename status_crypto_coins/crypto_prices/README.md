# Crypto Prices display for status bar

This is a simple price tracking of crypto that I use in the Arch Status Bar with DWM written in Golang and uses the CoinGeeko API for fetching the prices. Currently has these coins and can certainly be modified as per requirements.
- Ethereum
- Bitcoin
- Solana

Note: This was my first Golang Code ever written!
